The password for username bsf_user in the local environment should be
the same as that for the database user bsf_user in the production
environment.

The database password for bsf_user is stored in the db/.password.txt file.
You must create this file, put the password in it, and save the file.
You also need this password when you add bsf_user to the local environment.
For security reasons, the password file is ignored by Git.

Setting up the database and bsf_user on your local machine:
sudo su postgres -c psql
CREATE ROLE [local username] SUPERUSER LOGIN;
\q
createdb bsf_db_new
